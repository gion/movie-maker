movie-maker
===========

a html5 movie-maker like app

It's build with Yeoman (http://yeoman.io) and angularjs generator (https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)

In order to build the app, you need to have yeoman installed (which is as easy as `npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower`) and simply run `grunt` from the command line (because all the bootstrapping is already made and pushed in this repo). More info on yeoman (yo / bower/ grunt) commands at http://yeoman.io/ .

Good luck!
